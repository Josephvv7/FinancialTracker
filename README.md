# Project Title

## Description of the Project

The Financial Tracker Application is a console application made in Java that is designed to help users manage personal finances. 
This app does so by tracking deposits and payments.
In greater detail this application allows users to:
- Record financial transactions such deposits and payments
- View transaction history in different formats, 
- Generate customized financial reports, 
- Search transactions by vendors.

## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

- As a user, I want my transactions to be loaded from a file when the application starts so that I can access my previous transaction history

- As a user, I want to add new deposits to my transaction history so that I can track my income

- As a user, I want to add new payments to my transaction history so that I can track my expenses

- As a user, I want to view all my transactions in a ledger so that I can see my complete financial history

- As a user, I want to view only my deposit transactions so that I can analyze my income

- As a user, I want to view only my payment transactions so that I can analyze my expenses

- As a user, I want to generate a report of transactions from the current month so that I can review this month's activity

- As a user, I want to generate a report of transactions from the previous month so that I can review last month's activity

- As a user, I want to generate a report of transactions from the current year so that I can review this year's activity

- As a user, I want to generate a report of transactions from the previous year so that I can review last year's activity

- As a user, I want to search for transactions by vendor name so that I can review all transactions with a specific vendor

## Setup

Instructions on how to set up and run the project using IntelliJ IDEA.

### Prerequisites

- IntelliJ IDEA: Ensure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, which you can download from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
- Java SDK: Make sure Java SDK is installed and configured in IntelliJ.

### Running the Application in IntelliJ

Follow these steps to get your application running within IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Select "Open" and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the project.
3. After the project opens, wait for IntelliJ to index the files and set up the project.
4. Find the main class with the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
5. Right-click on the file and select 'Run 'YourMainClassName.main()'' to start the application.

## Technologies Used

- Java 17: This app is built using core features
- For handling dates and times I used java.time API
- java.io was used for file inputs and outputs
- java.util is used for scanner functionality
